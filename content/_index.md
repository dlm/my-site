I’m David Millman, a computer scientist and systems engineer.

I work at the intersection of algorithms, distributed systems, and developer
tooling. My recent work focuses on how software systems can verify what they
interact with, rather than relying on assumptions about their environment. In
practice, this means building systems that can reason about the authenticity
and integrity of the data, tools, and execution environments they depend on.

I was previously a professor at [Montana State
University](https://www.cs.montana.edu/), where my research focused on
algorithms, computational geometry, and topological data analysis. That work
continues to shape how I approach systems today: explicit guarantees, clear
abstractions, and an emphasis on correctness and rigor.

## This site

This site is a home for notes, experiments, and writing. It documents ideas,
systems, and lessons as they evolve rather than presenting a fixed point of
view. It’s intentionally lightweight, closer to a public notebook than a
polished portfolio.
