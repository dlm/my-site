Welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to share thoughts on computer science,
software development and the occasional debugging adventure.

This is where I'll write about technical insights, lessons learned,
and personal discoveries that I think would be interesting to share.

Stay tuned for more posts about algorithms, software, and maybe an occasional
post about life in beautiful Montana!
