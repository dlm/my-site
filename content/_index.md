I'm an Assistant Professor at Montana State University where I spend my days convincing computers to solve geometric puzzles that would make Euclid weep. My research focuses on computational geometry, which is basically getting machines to understand shapes better than most humans can parallel park.

Before landing in beautiful Montana, I collected degrees like Pokemon cards and published papers that approximately 12 people have read (including my mom, twice). I'm particularly passionate about making algorithms fast enough that you won't have time to make coffee while they run, though I make no promises about preventing you from making coffee anyway.

When I'm not debugging code that somehow turned a perfect circle into what can only be described as "geometric abstract art," you'll find me hiking Montana's trails, where the only computational complexity I worry about is whether I packed enough snacks. I also enjoy explaining to dinner party guests why computational geometry is definitely more exciting than it sounds (spoiler: it usually isn't, but the snacks make up for it).
