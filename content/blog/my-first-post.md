Welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to share thoughts on computational geometry, academic life, and the occasional debugging adventure.

This is where I'll write about research insights, teaching experiences, and maybe some stories about convincing computers to understand shapes (spoiler: it's harder than it sounds).

Stay tuned for more posts about algorithms, academia, and life in beautiful Montana!
