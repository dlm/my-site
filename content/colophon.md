This site is a personal website built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Some design elements were adapted from a template by
[Free CSS Templates](http://www.freecsstemplates.org/) in the mid-2000s and have
been modified over time. Additional styles, structure, and content are custom.

The fish imagery originates from a web-based rendering engine I created in 2006
as part of a graduate-level computer graphics course taught by [Ken
Perlin](https://cs.nyu.edu/~perlin/).

Some icons used on this site were generated with the assistance of large
language models and may resemble common iconography found in freely available
icon sets.

All content on this site is written and maintained by David Millman.
