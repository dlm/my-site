title: "The main function in nu module"

<!-- Start writing here -->
Outline:
- setup, describe what and why I am leaning nu.
- describe the unexpected behavior of main via an example
- describe how, in general, I think that this type of design technique is frustrating in that it smuggles a context sensitive keyword into the language.  Main is a common example, but others include `init` in go (and find some others).
- personally, I prefer something like python's approach in which these types of functions are "called out" pretty nicely in sytax via `__X__` methods.  But, curious about other approaches.
